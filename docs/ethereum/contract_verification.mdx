# Contract Verification

Once you have deployed your smart contracts, you can verify them on the
[explorer]. The following guide uses [hardhat].

## Via Flattened Source Code

1. Use the following command to get a flattened source code of your smart contract:

```bash
npx hardhat flatten path/to/your/contract.sol
```

2. Find your deployed contract on the [Kava explorer](https://kavascan.com) and follow the steps to verify.
   Make sure you import the contract .sol files as well as a metadata.json file for verification

## Via Standard-JSON-input file

1. Find your standard-json-input file or generate one from the `artifacts/build-info/{hash}.json` file. An example is shown below
``` bash
{
    "language": "Solidity",
    "sources": {
        "contracts/Storage.sol": {
            "content": "// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\n\npragma solidity 0.8.19;\n\ncontract Storage {\n    uint public storage_box;\n\n    function store(uint _value) public {\n        storage_box = _value;\n    }\n\n    function retrieve() public view returns (uint) {\n        return storage_box;\n    }\n}\n"
        }
    },
    "settings": {
        "optimizer": {
            "enabled": false,
            "runs": 200
        },
        "outputSelection": {
            "*": {
                "*": [
                    "abi",
                    "evm.bytecode",
                    "evm.deployedBytecode",
                    "evm.methodIdentifiers",
                    "metadata"
                ],
                "": [
                    "ast"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```
2. Upload the standard-input-json file to the explorer to verify your contract

## Via Hardhat Verification Plugin

You can also verify directly from your Hardhat development environment. This
requires the [`hardhat-etherscan`][hardhat-etherscan] plugin. The Kava explorer uses [cosmostation API]
which is compatible with the Hardhat Etherscan plugin.

1. [Install the Hardhat Etherscan plugin][hardhat-etherscan], ensuring
   that the version is `v3.1.0` or higher.
2. Ensure your `hardhat.config.js` file includes the following `etherscan`
   configuration:

```js title="hardhat.config.js"
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    kava: {
      url: 'https://evm.kava.io',
    },
  },
  // highlight-start
  etherscan: {
    apiKey: {
      kava: "9MgwdOWmMs", //"api key is not required by the Kava explorer, but can't be empty",
    },
    customChains: [
      {
        network: 'kava',
        chainId: 2222,
        urls: {
          apiURL: 'https://api.verify.mintscan.io/evm/api/0x8ae',
          browserURL: 'https://kavascan.com',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  // highlight-end
};
```

3. Verify that the custom network is configured correctly, by checking if kava
   is listed in the supported custom networks.

```bash
$ npx hardhat verify --list-networks

Networks supported by hardhat-etherscan:

...

Custom networks added by you or by plugins:

╔═════════╤══════════╗
║ network │ chain id ║
╟─────────┼──────────╢
║ kava    │ 2222     ║
╚═════════╧══════════╝
```

4. Verify the contract with `npx hardhat ignition verify <deployment-id>`. This may take a few minutes.
   The following is an example of verifying a Storage contract.

```bash
$ npx hardhat ignition verify chain-2222

Verifying contract "contracts/Storage.sol:Storage" for network kava...
Successfully verified contract "contracts/Storage.sol:Storage" for network kava:
  - https://kavascan.com/address/0xa8E48Fa04881DFacfC8d0aB84BC9bA57A449fc1F#code
```

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common errors and things to look out for when verifying your
contracts.

### `Bytecode does not match, please try again.`

Ensure the following options are the exact same as what you deployed with, then
try again.

- Compiler version
- Optimization runs
- ABI-encoded constructur arguments

### `There was an error compiling your contract: Multiple SPDX license identifiers found in source file`

Flattening your contracts may sometimes merge multiple dependent contracts also
with SPX identifiers (e.g. `// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0`).

Remove all SPDX comments except one in your flattened file and try verifying
again. Alternatively, use the hardhat verification plugin to preserve license
identifiers.

## Limitations

* Contracts with `'` can't be verified, to fix remove any `'` from your contract before submitting it for verification
* Contracts with flattened source code greater than 65000 characters can't be verified
